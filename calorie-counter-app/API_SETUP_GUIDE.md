# üîë API Setup Guide for Maximum Accuracy

Your Calorie Counter App is now working with a free nutrition database! However, for the most accurate and comprehensive results, I recommend adding additional free API keys.

## üéØ Current Status

‚úÖ **Working Now**: Free nutrition database with 50+ common foods  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Spoonacular API**: Rate limit reached (150 requests/day free tier)  
‚ùå **USDA & Edamam**: Not configured yet  

## üöÄ Quick Setup for Maximum Accuracy

### 1. USDA FoodData Central (RECOMMENDED - FREE)

**Why**: Most authoritative source, no rate limits, government data

**Steps**:
1. Go to: https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html
2. Click "Request an API Key"
3. Fill out the simple form (no payment required)
4. Copy your API key
5. Add it to `config.py`:
   ```python
   USDA_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
   ```

### 2. Edamam Nutrition API (FREE TIER)

**Why**: 10,000 requests per month, good accuracy

**Steps**:
1. Go to: https://developer.edamam.com/
2. Click "Get Started" ‚Üí "Nutrition Analysis API"
3. Create a free account
4. Get your App ID and App Key
5. Add to `config.py`:
   ```python

   EDAMAM_APP_KEY = "your_app_key_here"
   ```

### 3. Spoonacular API (Already Configured)

**Status**: Your key is working but has reached the free tier limit (150 requests/day)

**Upgrade Options**:
- Free: 150 requests/day
- Paid: $9.99/month for 5,000 requests/day

## üîß How to Add API Keys

1. **Edit config.py**:
   ```python
   # Replace the empty strings with your actual API keys
   USDA_API_KEY = "your_usda_key_here"
   EDAMAM_APP_ID = "your_edamam_app_id_here"
   EDAMAM_APP_KEY = "your_edamam_app_key_here"
   SPOONACULAR_API_KEY = "e12027af62fc4e129ebcba8de7c0e829"
   ```

2. **Test the setup**:
   ```bash
   python test_accuracy.py
   ```

3. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   python calorie_counter.py
   ```

## üéØ Expected Results After Setup

With all APIs configured, you'll get:
- **Multiple sources** for each food item

## üÜò Troubleshooting
